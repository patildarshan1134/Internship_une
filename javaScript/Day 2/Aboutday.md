0 > Strings in JavaScript
       # A string is a group of characters written inside quotes.
       # JavaScript has many built‑in methods to work with strings:

           1. length – finds how many characters are in a string.
           2. slice(start, end) – extracts a part of a string.
           3. trim() – removes extra spaces from the beginning and end.
           4. toUpperCase() – converts all letters to capital.
           5. toLowerCase() – converts all letters to small.

0 > Loops
       # Loops are used when you want to run a block of code again and again.
       # Common loops in JavaScript:

            1.for loop – repeats code a fixed number of times.
                    Syntax: for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement){...}

            2.while loop – checks the condition first, then runs the loop if true.
                    while(condition){..}
            3.do…while loop – runs the code once first, then checks the condition.
                                do{....}while(condition)



0 > Operators
            # Operators are symbols that perform specific operations on values.
            # Main types of operators in JavaScript:

                    1. Arithmetic Operators: + - * / %
                    2.Logical Operators: && || !
                    3.bitwise Operators: = += -= *=
                    4.Comparison Operators: == != > < >= <=


0 > Array
               # What is an Array in JavaScript?
                   > An array is a special variable that can store multiple values in a single place.
                   > Instead of creating separate variables for each value, you can store them all in one array.
                   > Values in an array are called elements and each element has an index (position).

Example:
         let fruits = ["Apple", "Mango", "Banana", "Orange"];
        How to Access Elements in an Array
                Array indexes start from 0.
                To access elements, use the index in square brackets:


      .log(fruits[0]); 
     console.log(fruits[2]); 


0 > Falsy Method
                    # what is fasly method
                     => Falsy method is aslo called as Conditional Statement
                     
                        > To control the flow of a program.
                        > To handle different situations in your code.
                        > To make your program smart and dynamic.


                EXAMPLES:-
                        # 1. If Statement
                            = >  Runs a block of code only if the condition is true.
                            = > Syntax : if(Statement){...}

                        # 2. if-else statement
                            =>   Runs one block(If block) of code if the condition is true and a different block(else block) if the condition is false.

                            => Syntax : if(Statement){...}else{....}

                        # 3. Switch Statement
                            =>  Used when you have many choices for one variable.
                            => Syntax : Switch(codition){
                                case 1:         //condition,statament;
                                .
                                .
                                . 
                                case n:          //condition,statament;
                            }

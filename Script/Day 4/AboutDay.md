# JavaScript Array Methods: forEach, map, and filter

In JavaScript, arrays come with several powerful methods to iterate and manipulate data. Three commonly used methods are forEach, map, and filter.

The forEach method is used to execute a given function once for each element in the array. For example, consider an array of user objects, each having a firstName and age. Using forEach, we can loop through each user and print their firstName. This method is useful when we want to perform an action (like logging or updating values) without returning a new array.

The map method is used when we want to transform each element of an array and get a new array in return. In the same user example, we can use map to extract only the firstName from each object and return a new array of just names. This is helpful when you want to create a derived array based on the original one without modifying the original data.

The filter method is useful when we want to filter out certain elements based on a condition. For instance, given an array of numbers, we can use filter along with a function (like checking if a number is even) to get a new array that includes only even numbers. This method returns a new array containing only the elements that satisfy the provided condition.

Together, these three methods — forEach, map, and filter — provide flexible and efficient ways to work with arrays in JavaScript.# JavaScript Array Methods: forEach, map, and filter

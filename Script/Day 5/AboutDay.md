# JavaScript DOM Card Project

This project demonstrates how to create a stylish profile card using JavaScript and DOM manipulation. Instead of writing HTML and CSS, all elements and styles are generated dynamically with JavaScript.

---

## How It Works

- The script starts by selecting the <body> element and setting its background color and layout to center the card.
- A main card <div> is created, styled with rounded corners, a border, and a soft background color.
- Inside the card, a navigation section holds a profile image and user information.
- The profile image is styled to appear circular with a white border, giving it a clean and modern look.
- The user's name, handle, and a short bio are displayed using heading elements, each styled for clarity and emphasis.
- Key statistics like views, projects, and followers are shown with bold numbers and labels, making the card informative and visually appealing.
- Two interactive buttons, "Follow" and "View profile," are added at the bottom. Clicking either button triggers a simple alert, demonstrating event handling in JavaScript.

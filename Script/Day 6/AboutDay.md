# JavaScript Calculator Project

This project is a simple web-based calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—on two input numbers.

---

## How It Works

- The user interface is created with HTML and styled using CSS for a clean, centered look.
- There are two input fields for entering numbers.
- Four buttons are provided for each operation: Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide.
- When a button is clicked, JavaScript reads the values from the input fields, performs the selected operation, and displays the result (typically using an alert or by updating the page).

## Features

- *Addition:* Adds the two numbers entered by the user.
- *Subtraction:* Subtracts the second number from the first.
- *Multiplication:* Multiplies the two numbers.
- *Division:* Divides the first number by the second, handling division by zero if implemented.

## Files

- *index.html:* Contains the calculator layout and links to the CSS and JavaScript files.
- *Calculator.js:* Implements the logic for each arithmetic operation and handles user interactions.
